# all eyes
#### *A python application able to detect and replace closed eyes in an image*


## Motivation
In a photo, closed eyes can occur for a number of reasons, such as the blinding light of a camera’s flash, a mistimed blink, or some other unexpected event. A single individual with closed eyes greatly reduces the picture’s quality and worth, prompting a retake. However, retaking the picture doesn’t ensure that all eyes will be open; a retake is just as much at risk as the initial image. All-eyes attempts to solve this problem using face and closed eye detection, local images, and in-painting to achieve a natural replacement.
