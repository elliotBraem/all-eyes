# all-eyes

  In a photo, closed eyes can occur for a number of reasons, such as the blinding light of a camera’s flash, a mistimed blink, or some other unexpected event. Nonetheless, a single individual with closed eyes greatly reduces the picture’s quality and worth; prompting a retake. However, retaking the picture doesn’t ensure that all eyes will be open; a retake is just as much at risk as the initial image. With more subjects come an increased chance that one of the individuals will have their eyes closed and although usually a good picture is taken, there is always a possibility a moment with all eyes open is not captured.
	All-eyes attempts to solve this problem using face and closed eye detection, local images, and in-painting to achieve a natural replacement.
